Weather App

Pretty much your basic run of the mill weather app after looking around and researching and looking at how to's and following along on structure and the look of the application this is what I have come up with. This is for my capstone project for Code:YOU front-end web development class.

Requirements:

Visual Appeal: The application uses a simple yet effecttive appeal.
Responsive Design: The site uses HTML CSS & Javascript.
GitHub Repository: The project is version controlled via Git, with at least 5 commits.
README File: A README file is included, describing the project and it's features and instructions on how to run the project.
Feature Implementation: Three features from the provided list are as follows:
1. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
2. Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc)
3. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. *Optional* Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and run the live server extension.
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. 
4. Once in the browser proceed to type in the name of your city or state and click on the magnifying glass.
5. Enjoy

*note* You may need to grab/register for an APIkey from openweathermap.org if their are issues.
